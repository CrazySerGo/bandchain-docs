# On CosmWasm

[CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) is an advanced smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. _Cosm_ refers to “Cosmos” while _Wasm_ refers to WebAssembly. CosmWasm uniquely enables developers to build multi-chain smart contracts, making use of the InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol.

CosmWasm contract can update and fetch the prices from Band Standard Dataset using Band's CosmWasm contract, deployed on their network.

The deployed contract addresses can be found in [Supported Blockchains](/develop/supported-blockchains/) Section.

For example CosmWasm contract, please refer to this [repository](https://github.com/bandprotocol/band-std-reference-contracts-cosmwasm)
